      <h3>Project Deliverables</h3>
      <p>For the JavaScript phase, of the software engineering course I am doing, we were told to build a Single Page Application (SPA) with the following requirements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.</li>
        <li>Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.</li> 
        <li>Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.</li>  
      </ol>
      <h3>Choosing the API</h3>
      <p>Finding an API that I could work with, that was free to use and required no authentication key was challenging but after researching and testing out different APIâ€™s I settled on the <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/">TheCocktailDB.com</a> API. This API is fairly easy to use and includes images of all the cocktails they have in their database which I thought would help make the app visually appealing.</p>
      <h3>Creating the SPA</h3>
      <p>I initially created a cocktail recipe app that had recipes for nine classic cocktails that I chose from the API database. It looked pretty good and would have satisfied all the project deliverables, but it was super basic so using the skills I have learned so far in my course plus getting some help from Google and a friend of mine, I changed the app to a cocktail recipe finder, which uses the search by cocktail API from <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/">TheCocktailDB.com</a>. The app is still basic, but it is more interactive with using the search bar to look up cocktails and depending on the cocktail searched, there could be search results for multiple cocktail recipes displayed. I also added the ability to like each cocktail with an animated like button that displays a pink heart that flips/rotates when clicked.</p>
      <h3>Delivering the SPA</h3>
      <p>To make sure I was hitting all the project deliverables, I set up a one-on-one session with my mentor to walk through what I had built. Luckily, he confirmed that I had met them all (phew!). I then had to create my first video presentation (eeek!) of the code, which I did by recording myself on Zoom and had to write a blog (the one youâ€™re currently readingðŸ˜Š) reflecting on the work I had done. </p>
      <h3>The End Result</h3>
      <p>Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with the way my <a href="https://olasrum.github.io/javascript-alternative-project/">cocktail recipe finder app</a> turned out, it is simple, and the code could probably be smarter and leaner, but it fits the project requirements, I think it looks good and it is actually useful, if youâ€™re looking to make some cocktails that is!</p>
