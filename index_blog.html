      <h3>Project Deliverables</h3>
      <p>For the JavaScript phase of the software engineering course I am doing, we were told to build a Single Page Application (SPA) with the following requirements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.</li>
        <li>Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.</li> 
        <li>Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.</li>  
      </ol>
      <h3>Choosing the API</h3>
      <p>Finding an API that I could work with, that was free to use and required no authentication key was challenging but after researching and testing out ideas I settled on the <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/">TheCocktailDB.com</a> API. The API is fairly easy to use and includes images of all the cocktails, in their database, which I thought would help make the app visually appealing. Using this API, I decided to create a simple classic cocktail recipe app with recipes for nine cocktails and the ability to like each individual cocktail.</p>
      <h3>Writing the Code</h3>
      <p>I used my Google skills together with skills learned so far in my course, to write the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code needed for this simple app. The code is fairly basic, it has fetch requests for the individual cocktails and the API data I used was for the images, ingredients, measures and instructions. The ingredients and measures werenâ€™t consistent across all the cocktails and if you just iterated over them all you would get a lot of â€˜nullâ€™ statements displayed so I had to tailor the length of each cocktail iteration. I also encountered unwanted nulls when an ingredient didnâ€™t have a standard measure i.e. slice of lemon is an ingredient but it didnâ€™t come with a set measurement so I had to display the ingredient on its own to avoid getting a result like; â€˜null: slice of lemonâ€™. To fulfill the interactivity requirements, I added an animated like button to each cocktail. When clicked the font and the heart change from black to pink, the like goes from â€˜likeâ€™ to â€˜likedâ€™ and the heart does a little rotation/flip to the left.</p>
      <h3>Delivering the Single Page Application</h3>
      <p>To make sure I was hitting all the project deliverables, I set up a one-on-one session with my mentor to walk through what I had built. Luckily, he confirmed that I had met them all (phew!). I then had to create my first video presentation (eeek!) of the code, which I did by recording myself on Zoom and had to write a blog (the one youâ€™re currently readingðŸ˜Š) reflecting on the work I had done. </p>
      <h3>The End Result</h3>
      <p>Overall Iâ€™m happy with the way my <a href="https://olasrum.github.io/javascript-project-mode/">cocktail recipe app</a> turned out, it is simple and the code could definitely be smarter and leaner, but it fits the project requirements, I think it looks good and it is actually useful, if youâ€™re looking to make some cocktails that is! </p>
